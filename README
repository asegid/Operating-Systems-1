Hello, I am @dileep98490These are the C-programmes that I created as part of our Operating Systems Lab.The OS_LAB document contains the questions for Day-1 and Day-2. Also all the programmes were given continuously in it, for an easy overview.Visit my blog http://operatingsystemscode.blogspot.in/ for explanation about how to use the code snippets.
